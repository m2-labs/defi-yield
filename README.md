# üìà defi-yield

All Solana DeFi yields in one package.

Currently supported protocols:

* [Apricot](https://apricot.one)
* [Francium](https://francium.io)
* [Jet Protocol](https://jetprotocol.io)
* [Mango Markets](https://mango.markets)
* [Port Finance](https://port.finance)
* [Solend](https://solend.fi)
* [Tulip](https://tulip.garden)

All data is fetched directly from the Solana blockchain, using the native protocol SDK when available. This project does not use screen-scraping or 3rd party APIs.  To prevent rate-limiting, this project attempts to use the officially supported RPCs for each project.
